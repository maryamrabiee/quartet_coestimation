================== ASTRAL ===================== 

This is ASTRAL version 5.7.8
Gene trees are treated as unrooted
15 trees read from data/output/quco-out.tre.nw
index0
All output trees will be *arbitrarily* rooted at A

======== Running the main analysis
Number of taxa: 6 (6 species)
Taxa: [A, B, C, D, E, F]
Taxon occupancy: {A=10, B=10, C=10, D=10, E=10, F=10}
Number of gene trees: 15
15 trees have missing taxa
